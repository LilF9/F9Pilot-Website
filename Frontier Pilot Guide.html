                        Think of FDO as a long block of <strong class="dark-green-text">Long Call Reserve</strong> (LCR) days. You are not required to be on call at your domicile, but you must be scheduled for a 31-hour rest period within every 7-day period. Because of the predictable nature of FDO lines, they are not eligible for Aggressive Reserve or dropping/swapping days.

                        The "Want to Fly" list allows Reserve pilots to proactively seek out flying assignments. By calling Scheduling by 1200 LDT the day before, you can add your name to a list of pilots eager to be assigned. Available trips are then awarded to pilots on this list in seniority order.

                        This is a way for you to actively bid for open trips. It's an opportunity to get a trip you want instead of waiting for Crew Scheduling to call you.

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-4 text-sm text-gray-800">
                <li>
                    <strong class="dark-green-text">Scheduling Mistakes:</strong> Don't be afraid to challenge crew scheduling if you believe they've made an error. Simply text your ALPA mentor or submit a <strong class="dark-green-text">DART</strong> for the situation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="dark-green-text">Your Right to a Two-Hour Call-In:</strong> When on reserve, crew scheduling may sometimes ask you to report within the two-hour window. Remember, you have the contractual right to the full two hours to get to the airport. Don't hesitate to ask for it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="dark-green-text">Utilize Your Union Rep:</strong> Your union reps are here to help you. Never think you're "bugging" them by sending a DART or a text. They are glad to assist and there are multiple people on each committee, so if one is busy, another will happily respond.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="dark-green-text">Filing a Grievance:</strong> If you believe the company has broken a contract rule, do not be afraid to file a grievance report. This is a formal way to hold the company accountable for its actions and protect your rights. <em class="">If this is your first time, I would highly recommend submitting a DART to the Grievance Committee first for their assistance.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="dark-green-text">Speak Up, Even on Probation:</strong> Your probationary period is a time of evaluation, but it doesn't mean you should stay silent on safety or contractual issues. When something seems wrong, contact your union first so they can guide you. The system works because pilots, including new hires, use it to report issues and advocate for a safer workplace.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="dark-green-text">Stay Informed:</strong> When you have downtime, consider glancing over sections of the CBA that are relevant to your current situation, such as <strong class="dark-green-text">Section 25.R (Reserve)</strong>, to become more familiar with the rules and your rights.
