                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">Posted on: <strong>June 14, 2025</strong></p>
                    <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        A message from the family:
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        Last spring Ben was diagnosed with a rare abdominal cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma. The tumor grew large and fast. Over the past year Ben has gone through a series of treatments and was able to eventually have the tumor removed. Unfortunately, the damage to Ben‚Äôs stomach from the treatments and surgery was significant, causing issues with his ability to eat. Doctors have been working closely with the Pratt‚Äôs to find a long-term solution. Everyone was very optimistic that he was nearing the end of his cancer journey. He was looking forward to returning to work and getting back to life as normal.

                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        Unfortunately, over the past few weeks, May/early June, Ben began having significant abdominal pain again. Friday, June 6th, Ben‚Äôs mom drove him down to Moffitt in Tampa, hoping to help resolve his pain. Upon being admitted, tests reveled that the tumor growth had returned, more aggressive than it had been previously. In addition, they found that the scar tissue in what remained of his stomach was too significant for any viable, long-term nutritional options. On Wednesday, June 11th, the Pratt family made the incredibly difficult decision to move Ben to hospice. Their incredible network of friends were able to help move him into a hospice facility close to home.

                        If you know the Pratt family, you know how amazing they are and how big their hearts are. They‚Äôve always been the ones to show up for others - with love, with laughter, with kindness. Now it‚Äôs our turn to show up for them.

                        Ben, Lindsey and the kids are beyond thankful for the love and support they have received and continue to receive. Thank you all.
